Bitcoin-Price-Change-Alert
==========================

Sends a notification when the price of Bitcoin changes by a certain threshold

As new APIs (GDAX, Coinmarketcap, etc.) make the Bitcoin price available, web-scraping is no longer necessary. A newer version of this script which consumes the GDAX API will be made available in the future.
